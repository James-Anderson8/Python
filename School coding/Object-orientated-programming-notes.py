# Functions inside classes are called methods/behaviours.

__dict__ # Returns all attributes and methods of the class level

# self is an auto generated parameter - when method is called it passes the object itself as the first argument.

# Instance (Instance is good1) of the class Good, calls actions under the __init__ method.

# __repr__ Returns a string representation of the object

# Class methods need to have a @classmethod decorator before the method definition to show its a class method.
